Hello there, Thanks for landing in my personal space! I'm Amna. I was born and raised in Khartoum, Sudan. I spent the last two years, however, between Senegal and the US.
I got my undergrad from Khartoum University with a major in Electrical and Electronics Engineering, where I was also interested in taking macroeconomics/public policy courses. In my final year, I heard about Machine Learning and started the learning journey with an independent research, published in IEEEXplore.

After working in different companies in process control and software engineering, I decided to go further in the ML journey and started a one-year Master at AMMI in Senegal.
This experience opened the gate to many possibilities, most notably to great connections to researchers from FAIR and Google AI! 

More than that, I was able to learn during a one year internship with David Rolnick at MILA. 

Fall 2022, I began A completely different experience! Working As a predoc researcher at Stanford King Center under the supervision of Stefano Ermon, David Lobell and Irene Lo. 

I'm generally interested in using novel data and computational methods to achieve sustainable development in low-income countries and conflict regions with a focus on climate, poverty, and agricultural applications. I have used in the past remote sensing as a novel data source for scarce data regimes. But interested in exploring more novel data methods
