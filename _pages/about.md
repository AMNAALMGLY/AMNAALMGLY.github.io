Hello there, Thanks for landing into my personal space! I'm Amna. I was born and raised in Khartoum, Sudan, a very big and diverse country with very narraw minded and intolerant  politicians! I spent the last 2 years however between Senegal and US.
I got my undergard from Khartoum University with a major in Electrical and Electronics Engineering, where I was also interested in taking macro economics/public policy courses. In final year, I heard about Machine Learning and kicked off the learning journey with this project, published in IEEEXplore.

After working in different companies there in process control and software engineering, I decided to rather go further in the ML journey and started  a one-year Master at AMMI in Senegal.
This experience opened the gate to many possibilities, most importantly to great connections to great researches from FAIR & google AI! 

More than that, I was able to learn during a 1 year internship  with David Rolnick at MILA. 

Fall 2022 I began A completely different experience! As a predoc researcher at Stanford king center, working  with Stefano Ermon, David Lobell and Irene Lo. 

I'm generally interested in the question of using novel data and computational methods to achieve sustainable development in low-income countries and conflict regions with a focus on climate, poverty & agricultural applications. I have used in the past remote sensing as a novel data source for scarce data regimes. But interested to explore more novel data methods
