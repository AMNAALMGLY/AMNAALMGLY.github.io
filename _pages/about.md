Hello! Thanks for landing here ðŸ™‚.I'm Amna, A Sudanese woman who enjoys challenging everthing! except your existence ðŸ˜¬. I was born and raised in Khartoum, Sudan, a very big and diverse country with very narraw minded and intolerant  politicians! I spent the last 2 years however between Senegal and US.
I got my undergard from Khartoum University with a major in Electrical and Electronics Engineering, where I was also interested in taking macro economics/public policy courses. In final year, I heard about Machine Learning and kicked off the learning journey with this [paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9070840)

After working in different companies there in process control and software engineering, I decided to rather go into research in ML and started  a one-year Master at AMMI in Senegal.
This experience opened the gate to many possibilities, most importantly to great connections to great researches from FAIR & google AI amongst others! for ex: Laurens van der

More than that, I was able to learn more during a 1-year internship  with David Rolnick at MILA. 

Fall 2022 I began A completely different experience! As a predoc researcher at Stanford king center, working  with Stefano Ermon, David Lobell and Soledad Parilliman on [various projects](https://amnaalmgly.github.io/assets/pdf/CV_Dec.pdf) 

I'm generally interested in the question of out of distribution generalization and causal inference with applications to computational sustainability and poverty questions.

It is worth noting that during my undergrad back in Sudan `research` was very  uncommon word. When we published our [first paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9070840) in final year, we were one of 1% of students who published that year. while we had no supervision provided during working on that paper. This is the strongest reason that keeps me motivated to push forward this research journey.I was also awarded AMMI scholarship, with less than 6% acceptance rate, as well as [DAAD Leadership for Africa](https://www.daad.eg/en/about-us/about-the-daad/) scholarship. Besides I was one of 5% top performant students in both undergrad and master.

Outside of research, I mostly enjoy reading and discussing political and ethical philosophy. I also enjoy watching and discussing cinema. Moreover, I'm always happier after practicing creative writing or piano playing.
