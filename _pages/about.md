Hello there, Thanks for landing here.I'm Amna, was born and raised in Khartoum, Sudan. I spent the last two years, however, between Senegal and the US.
I got my undergrad from Khartoum University with a major in Electrical and Electronics Engineering, where I was also interested in taking macroeconomics/public policy courses. In my final year, I heard about Machine Learning and started the learning journey with an [independent research](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9070840), published in IEEEXplore.

After working in different companies in software engineering, I decided to go further in the research path and got [AMMI scholarship](https://aimsammi.org/), A master program in machine intelligence in Senegal.
This experience opened the gate to a collaboration with the Stanford AI lab. More than that, I was able to learn during an internship with [David Rolnick](https://davidrolnick.com/) at MILA on biodervisty monitering. Fall 2022, I began a different experience, working As a predoc researcher at [Stanford King Center](https://kingcenter.stanford.edu/) under the supervision of [Stefano Ermon](https://cs.stanford.edu/~ermon/), [David Lobell](https://fse.fsi.stanford.edu/people/david_lobell) and [Irene Lo](https://sites.google.com/view/irene-lo). 
I'm generally interested in using novel data and computational methods to achieve sustainable development in low-income countries and conflict regions with a focus on climate, poverty, and agricultural applications. I have used in the past remote sensing as a novel data source for scarce data regimes. But interested in exploring more novel data methods
