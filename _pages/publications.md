Hello there, Thanks for landing into my personal space! I'm Amna, A Sudanese women who enjoys challenging everthing! except your existence(emoji). I was born and raised in Khartoum, Sudan, a very big and diverse country with very narraw minded and intolerant  politicians! I spent the last 2 years however between Senegal and US.
I got my undergard from Khartoum University with a major in Electrical and Electronics Engineering, where I was also interested in taking macro economics/public policy courses. In final year, I heard about Machine Learning and kicked off the learning journey with this project, published in IEEEXplore.

After working in different companies there in process control and software engineering, I decided to rather go further in the ML journey and started  a one-year Master at AMMI in Senegal.
This experience opened the gate to many possibilities, most importantly to great connections to great researches from FAIR & google AI! 

More than that, I was able to learn during a 1 year internship  with David Rolnick at MILA. 

Fall 2022 I began A completely different experience! As a predoc researcher at Stanford king center, working  with Stefano Ermon, David Lobell and Soledad Parilliman on some cool projects(link) 

I'm generally interested in the question of out of distribuiton generalization and causal inference with applications to computational sustainability and poverty questions.
